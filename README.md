## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Layout

### What I learned

- I learnt how to manipulate the flexbox layout model, in order to come up with a replica of this design.

- I learnt how to adjust the size of the `div` container in order to place the image side by side with the text container.

- I learnt the effective usage of flexbox and making the model responsive for screen and mobile devices.

- I learnt how to hide and reveal images to match certain responsiveness for various devices.
